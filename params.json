A passphrase is similar to a password in usage, but is generally longer for added security. Passphrases are often used to control both access to, and operation of, cryptographic programs and systems. Passphrases are particularly applicable to systems that use the passphrase as an encryption key. The origin of the term is by analogy with password. The modern concept of passphrases is believed to have been invented by Sigmund N. Porter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nWhat is different in this??\r\nThe algorithm which I use made this different from other generators\r\nUsually generators generate by collecting the letters from different buckets and together give it as password or passphrase, but here the core concept of cryptographically secure random bit generator. This works by choosing 130 bits from a cryptographically secure random bit generator, and encoding them in base-32. 128 bits is considered to be cryptographically strong, but each digit in a base 32 number can encode 5 bits, so 128 is rounded up to the next multiple of 5. This encoding is compact and efficient, with 5 random bits per character. Compare this to a random UUID, which only has 3.4 bits per character in standard layout, and only 122 random bits in total.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\nA seek Bar is provided to vary the length of the passphrase generated the minimum of length is 6 and maximum of 18 characters will be present in the passphrase\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
